# Migrate It

This is the source code for the [Migrate It presentation](https://www.josephguadagno.net/presentations/migrate-it).

This presentation is about converting a .NET Framework 4.5.2 application to .NET Core 3.1

The sample application was taken from the WingtipToys example which is talked about in the article [Getting Started with ASP.NET 4.5 Web Forms and Visual Studio 2013](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-community-d-l/tree/874319833afb938da9a309f7821688bbe76b4fb0/Getting%20Started%20with%20ASP.NET%204.5%20Web%20Forms%20and%20Visual%20Studio%202013%20-%20Wingtip%20Toys).
